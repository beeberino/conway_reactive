Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by under population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Create an N x N grid of cells that have random assignments of alive/dead state and write a program that will return the next state of the board and its cells

Additional challenges (if time allows):
   * How would you scale this to larger grids?
   * output grid in console as X for alive cells and O for dead cells
   * create JS/React app that calls backend GoL code to render grid in browser
        * enable toggling live cells on the fly, pause/play functionality
   * allow board to take a seed value such as "Gosper's glider, etc."
